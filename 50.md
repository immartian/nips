NIP-50
======

Relay DM Commands
-----------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:immartian`

The `whitelist` tag enables a trusted user to specify a list of users allowed to for a target relay.

#### Spec

```
tag: whitelist
values:
 - [public key, public key, ...]: required
 - [wss:... ]: required
```

#### Example

```json
{
    "pubkey": "<pub-key>",
    "created_at": 1000000000,
    "kind": 1,
    "tags": [
      ["whitelist", "npub....", "wss://"]
    ],
    "content": "We will add some trustable clients to your esteemed relay for previlledge processing.\n",
    "id": "<event-id>"
}
```

Note: Relay server should have a configuration to memorize the "trusted" user which can send the tag.

Client Behavior
---------------

Clients SHOULD use the `supported_nips` field to learn if a relay supports this NIP. Clients SHOULD NOT send expiration events to relays that do not support this NIP. 

Clients SHOULD not send request if it's not in the trusted user of the relay.

Relay Behavior
--------------

Relays SHOULD ignore the request if the client is not in it's trusted client list.  
Relays MAY block the client which is not in the trusted client list.  

Suggested Use Cases
-------------------

* Home server - This tag can create a trusted sub-network to enable a mini relay only serves local clients(like devices) to exchange status and commands securely.
* Business server - This tag can also create a business sub-network to enable a privileged cluster to exchange status and/or commands between staffs and devices

#### Warning
Don't consider it's fully secure if the relay server per se is not well configured.
